                    Hi, and welcome to JB Programming!
                    If you are new, and don't know my channel, my name is Jerry, and I like to program.
                    I make a variety of programming videos from just learning a language to game development.
                    I do tutorials on multiple languages, and I try to make them as high-quality as possible.
                    I may never be as popular as gaming channels like Josh The Nerd, but at least I try!
                </p>
