                <p>
                    The main thing I do on my channel is programming.
                    You probably would've guessed that when you saw the name of my channel.
                    My programming is very general.
                    I do tutorials for a beginner to my channel, and I also do more advanced stuff like game building.
                    Currently, I am doing two things.
                    They are website development and java.
                    Website development contains three languages (or at least that is all I will most likely do), HTML,
                    CSS, and JavaScript.
                    I will explain this more in detail when I go into specifics on certain series.
                </p>
                <h3 class="header">Jerry's Thoughts</h3>
                <p>
                    One of the biggest series I do in my channel is Jerry's Thoughts.
                    This is when I talk about my thoughts in general, and science as well.
                    Every once in a while, I will tie it back to programming, but if you aren't that interested in
                    programming, this might be something you want to watch.
